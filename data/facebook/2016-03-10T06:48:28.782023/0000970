My dad had a fall where he needs to do MRI for his spine that could cost more then $800 and need to pay in CASH. Both of us are outpatients, both of us have money in our Medisave. But we can't use it because we are outpatients. MRI are expensive to many of us. What if someone who has a serious medical condition that needs to go MRI but because he is an outpatient and cant afford to pay cash? Must he be in near death situation to be hospitalised so he can use his Medisave for an MRI? Wouldn't that be to late if someone could have gone to MRI before the condition become worsen?",
