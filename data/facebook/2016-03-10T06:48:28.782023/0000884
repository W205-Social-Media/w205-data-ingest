The show is definitely building up and you have to all realize that even though you think it is boring right now, they are building characters so when the shit does hit the fan, you can have a better understanding of why.  Its called GOOD FILM MAKING.  Unfortunately, we are in an age of instant excitement, we no longer use our brains, we have no patience and we absolutely will not watch a boring show, even if it is absolute that it will blow our minds eventually.
