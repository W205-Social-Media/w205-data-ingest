But we haven't told you what started this huge project. It all begun that a Coach named Frank from a team called Addisson Academy one day started noticing his players was doing skills that they haven't done before, so he asked them: Where did you learn that? And the kids from his team answered: From a YouTube channel called SkillTwins. After this, the Coach went home and searched on SkillTwins on YouTube and thaught that our videos was fantastic. Then, 9 months later after a lot of hard work and preperations, we took a flight to USA and had our own \"SkillTwins Camp\" in Chicago! It was one of the coolest experience we ever had! During thoose days, we have never worked so hard in our life before since we worked 9 hours everyday nonstop for 3 weeks but it was totally worth it. It's was so inspiring to teach out SkillTwins skills to fans that have travelled all the way from Mexico, China, New York to USA to be learned by us, it felt surealistic. One guy even traveled 2 hours everyday for about 2 weeks to be in the camp. What also got us so inpired was when we got messages by the kids and their parents telling us that it was the best camp they ever been to. To see the kids improvement on the skills on such a short amount of time was an fantastic feeling. And the funny thing with the camp was that we become friends with all of the kids and everyday consisted of enjoy and many hours of hard work, which we think is 2 keys to development...To train hard and enjoy your training sessions! And we could really see that the kids enjoyed the camp which felt awesome! On the camp, we learned out how to improve your ball control, footwork, football & freestyle skills! We will make many videos from the camp where you can see the kids improvement! Thank you all for coming to the camp, we will NEVER forget this... Unforgettable Journey! \u2764\ufe0f\u26bd\ufe0f - SkillTwins, Josef & Jakob!",
