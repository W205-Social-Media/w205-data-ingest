              "message": "Leave it in CPF, then at 55, they make you buy CPF Life annuity and suck your hard earn money dry. At 55, assuming you have the minimum $161,000. The first $30,000 at interest of 6%, the next $30,000 at 5% interest and the balance of $101,000 at 4% interest. Just to a simple mathematics calculation as one Minister say it. You should enjoy having enough money to last you till 92-96 years old. But if you buy CPF Life and you die at 85, you have nothing for your children. The balance will be banker (CPF) takes all. So why should I be forced to buy CPF Life. Even the Saudi King die at 91 years old, how can CPF assured me that I could live much longer than the Saudi King. I am not a billionaire which can afford the best medical teams in the world. Average Singapore life, maybe 82-85, so CPF Life is a sure win for CPF but not for ordinary people like me. I may not be a scholar to come out with such scheme but I have logical mind to be able to calculate based on simple calculation. The truth is in the calculation. So CPF, show to us the proper calculation based on the fact that I have stated. If I am wrong, you could have my CPF. If I am right, let me be the banker for CPF Life, I would be a millionaire maybe a billionaire without doing much but by placing the amount in CPF and earning the interest. We are not scholars but we are not dumb too. Prove to me that I am wrong and I will sincerely apologize but I stand by my word. I am 100% correct. It's KARMA, sucking ordinary people money. Or you already run out of ideas to make money???",
